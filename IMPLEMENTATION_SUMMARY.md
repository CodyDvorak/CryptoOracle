# Implementation Summary - Oracle Scan Fix & New Features

## Overview
This document summarizes all fixes and new features implemented in this session.

---

## 1. Oracle Scan Fix ✅

### Problem Identified
The Oracle scan was getting stuck in "RUNNING" status for 10+ minutes and not completing. The issue was caused by:
- Edge function timeout (10-minute hard limit)
- No timeout protection in the scan process
- Inadequate error handling for background processes
- Large dataset (200 coins) taking too long to process

### Solution Implemented

**File: `/supabase/functions/scan-run/index.ts`**

1. **Added Timeout Protection**
   - Implemented 8-minute maximum scan time (before 10-min edge function timeout)
   - Scan gracefully exits early if approaching timeout
   - Processes as many coins as possible within time limit

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better error catching in background process
   - Automatic status updates on failures
   - Detailed error messages in database

3. **Improved Logging**
   - Duration tracking for each scan
   - Progress indicators showing coins processed
   - Warning messages when approaching timeout

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
const scanStartTime = Date.now();
const MAX_SCAN_TIME = 8 * 60 * 1000; // 8 minutes

// In scan loop:
if (Date.now() - scanStartTime > MAX_SCAN_TIME) {
  console.warn(`⏱️ Approaching timeout. Processed ${processedCoins}/${coinsToAnalyze.length} coins.`);
  break;
}
```

### Status
- ✅ Code fixed and ready
- ⚠️ **Requires redeployment** of the `scan-run` edge function
- The scan will now complete successfully even if it can't process all coins

---

## 2. WebSocket Support ✅

### Insights Page - Live Alerts

**Status:** ✅ Already Implemented

The `RealtimeUpdates` component was already integrated with WebSocket support for:
- Whale activity alerts (large transactions)
- Market alerts (breaking news)
- Real-time price movements

**Tables Used:**
- `whale_alerts` - Monitors large crypto transactions
- `market_alerts` - Tracks important market events

### BotPerformance Page - Live Accuracy Updates

**Status:** ✅ Already Implemented

Real-time updates for:
- Bot accuracy rate changes

**CSS: `/src/components/MarketRegimeTimeline.css`**

Features:
- Visual timeline showing market regime changes (BULL, BEAR, SIDEWAYS)
- Proportional segment widths based on duration
- Current regime indicator with pulsing animation
- Period summary with regime statistics
- Time range selector (7d, 30d, 90d)
- Coin-specific regime tracking

### Integration

**File: `/src/pages/Insights.jsx`**
- Added to Insights page (makes more sense than History for market analysis)
- Displays below Market Correlation component
- Shows regime changes for selected coin

---

## 6. Market Correlation Analysis API Requirements ✅

### Documentation Created

**File: `/MARKET_CORRELATION_API_REQUIREMENTS.md`**

Comprehensive documentation including:

**Recommended APIs:**
1. **CoinGecko API** (Primary recommendation)
   - Free tier: 50 calls/minute
   - Historical price data
   - Documentation links provided

2. **CoinMarketCap API**
   - Free tier: 333 calls/day
   - OHLCV historical data

3. **CryptoCompare API**
   - Free tier: 100,000 calls/month
   - Daily historical data

**Implementation Guide:**
- Data collection strategy
- Correlation calculation formula (Pearson coefficient)
- Database schema (already created)
- Edge function pseudo-code
- Cost considerations and optimization strategies
- Security best practices

**Current Status:**
- ✅ UI component exists and works with mock data
- ✅ Database schema created
- ❌ Real API integration pending (requires API keys)
- ❌ Correlation calculation logic needs implementation

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Oracle Scan Timeout**
   - ✅ Fixed in code
   - ⚠️ May still timeout for 200+ coins with all features
   - Recommendation: Reduce Oracle scan to 100-150 coins or increase edge function timeout if possible

2. **Bot Performance History**
   - Table created but no data yet
   - Needs cron job to populate historical snapshots
   - Component will show "No historical data" until populated

3. **Market Correlation**
   - Uses mock data currently
   - Requires external API integration for real data
   - Full implementation guide provided in documentation

4. **WebSocket Tables**
   - `whale_alerts` and `market_alerts` exist but not being populated
   - Need separate services to detect and insert alerts
   - UI components are ready and will work once data flows
