The trajectory outlines the development of a Crypto Oracle application, a full-stack tool for AI-driven cryptocurrency trading recommendations. The project underwent significant evolution, starting with data source pivots from Binance and CoinGecko to a stable CryptoCompare API. A major feature phase introduced user-requested enhancements like price filters, advanced scheduling, and UI refinements.

A key strategic shift involved integrating the TokenMetrics API for its AI grades, which led to complex pre-filtering logic. However, based on user feedback, this was later removed to simplify the architecture and rely solely on CryptoCompare for data sourcing and analysis by the 21 internal bots.

The most substantial development cycle was the implementation of a full-fledged user authentication system. This required creating backend user models, JWT-based auth services, and protected endpoints. The frontend was refactored to use React Context for state management,  for navigation between the main dashboard, login/register pages, and a new user-specific scan history page.

The final messages in the trajectory focus on resolving persistent user-reported issues: a faulty auto-refresh mechanism on the frontend after a scan completes and a failure in the email notification system. The engineer's last actions were aimed at fixing these two specific problems.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build Crypto Oracle, a personalized, AI-powered agent that analyzes the cryptocurrency market and provides actionable trading recommendations.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **User Authentication:** Users must be able to register and log in with a username and password.
*   **Personalized Experience:** All data, including scans, recommendations, and history, must be tied to the logged-in user's account.
*   **Analysis Engine:** The system utilizes 21 AI bots to analyze market data sourced exclusively from the CryptoCompare API.
*   **Categorized Recommendations:** Upon scan completion, the app identifies and displays the top 5 coins in three categories: highest confidence, biggest percentage movers, and biggest dollar volume movers.
*   **Automated Email Notifications:** After every scan, the system must automatically send a summary of the results to the user's registered email address.
*   **On-Demand & Scheduled Scans:** Users can run scans on-demand with custom filters (price range, specific coin lists) or schedule them to run automatically.
*   **Scan History:** A dedicated History page allows users to review their past scans and the raw recommendations generated, without success-rate analytics.
*   **Auto-Refreshing UI:** The main dashboard must automatically update with the latest scan results upon completion without requiring a manual browser refresh.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI, Motor for asynchronous MongoDB access, and APScheduler for background tasks.
- **Frontend:** JavaScript with React, utilizing React Router for navigation and React Context for global state management (authentication).
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, scan configurations, and recommendations.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing API endpoints, with bcrypt for password hashing.
- **External APIs:** CryptoCompare for all market data and SMTP for sending email notifications.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with separate  and  directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main FastAPI application file. It defines all API endpoints.
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified to include a robust authentication system with  and  endpoints, JWT dependency injection to protect routes, and user-specific endpoints for running scans and fetching history. Logic for initializing  was simplified to rely only on CryptoCompare.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core engine that runs the analysis. It fetches data, applies filters, runs the 21 bots, and saves results.
    -   **Changes:** Significantly refactored to be user-aware, accepting a  for all operations. The data pipeline was simplified to use only CryptoCompare. A crucial update was made to its  method to automatically trigger an email notification to the user upon scan completion.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines Pydantic models for data validation and database structure.
    -   **Changes:** A  model was added for the authentication system. The  and  models were updated to include a  field to associate data with specific users.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main dashboard component. It handles state for scans, recommendations, and UI controls.
    -   **Changes:** Refactored to integrate with the  to get user data and authorization tokens for API calls. A user menu with a logout button was added. The auto-refresh logic, which polls for scan completion, has been a frequent point of modification and is the subject of the current debugging effort.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new file that provides a global authentication state for the entire React application.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch to manage user login, registration, logout, and JWT token storage in . It exposes auth functions and user state to all components.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new page for viewing a user's past scans.
    -   **Changes:** Created to display a list of historical scans. It was initially built with success-rate tracking features, which were later removed at the user's request to simplify the view to just raw recommendation data. Navigation was added to allow users to return to the main dashboard.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the frontend auto-refresh functionality to ensure the dashboard automatically updates with new results immediately after a scan is completed, without requiring a manual refresh.
- Ensure the email notification system works reliably, so that every scan (both manual and scheduled) automatically sends the results to the email address the user registered with.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The engineer was actively debugging two critical, user-reported issues. The user stated that email notifications were not being sent and the application was not auto-refreshing after a scan completed.

**Last Actions Taken:**

1.  **Email Fix (Backend):** The engineer modified the  method in . The logic was updated to fetch the user's details from the database at the beginning of a scan and then call the  method upon completion, ensuring the user's registered email is used for the notification.

    

2.  **Auto-Refresh Fix (Frontend):** The engineer began investigating the faulty auto-refresh logic in . They identified the polling mechanism inside the  function as the likely culprit and were in the process of implementing a more aggressive and less strict polling condition to force the data refresh when the trajectory ended.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Finalize the implementation of a more robust auto-refresh mechanism in  by making the polling condition less strict and adding a fallback to ensure the recommendations are always fetched after the polling loop concludes.
