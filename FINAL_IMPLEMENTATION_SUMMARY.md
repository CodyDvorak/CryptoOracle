## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES (100%)

### 1. Market Regime Classification System ✅

**What It Does:**
Automatically classifies every coin's market condition into three regimes with confidence scores.

**Regimes:**
- 🐂 **BULL** (Trending Up): Strong uptrend, momentum-driven
- 🐻 **BEAR** (Trending Down): Strong downtrend, fear-driven
- ↔️ **SIDEWAYS** (Ranging): Consolidation, choppy, mean-reverting

**Analysis Methods:**
1. **Trend Analysis** - MA alignment, price position, EMA slopes
2. **Volatility Analysis** - ATR, Bollinger width, ADX strength
3. **Momentum Indicators** - RSI, MACD, Stochastic, CCI
4. **Price Action** - Higher highs/lows, price structure

**Implementation:**
- File: `supabase/functions/scan-run/market-regime-classifier.ts`
- 4-factor weighted scoring system
- Confidence threshold: 0.6 - 0.95
- Detailed reasoning output

**Example Output:**
```javascript
{
  regime: 'BULL',
  confidence: 0.85,
  reasons: [
    'Golden alignment: EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA200',
    'Price above 200 EMA (bullish)',
    'Strong momentum: RSI = 68.3',
    'MACD bullish: Histogram positive'
  ]
}
```

### 2. Regime-Aware Bot Weighting ✅

**What It Does:**
Intelligently adjusts bot predictions based on which market regime we're in.

**Weighting System:**

**BULL Market** (1.3x weight):
- Momentum Trader
- Trend Following
- Breakout Hunter
- EMA Golden Cross
- MACD Crossover
- ADX Trend Strength
- Volume Spike
- Whale Activity Tracker

**BEAR Market** (1.3x weight):
- Mean Reversion
- EMA Death Cross
- Bollinger Squeeze
- RSI Oversold/Overbought
- Parabolic SAR

**SIDEWAYS Market** (1.4x weight):
- RSI Oversold/Overbought
- Mean Reversion
- Support/Resistance
- Bollinger Breakout
- VWAP Trader
- Pivot Points
- Stochastic Oscillator
- Williams %R

**Formula:**
```
baseConfidence = bot.analyze(data)
regimeWeight = getRegimeWeight(botName, currentRegime)
regimeConfidence = marketRegime.confidence

finalConfidence = baseConfidence × regimeWeight × regimeConfidence
finalConfidence = min(finalConfidence, 0.98)
```

**Implementation:**
- File: `supabase/functions/scan-run/regime-aware-aggregator.ts`
- Dynamic weighting based on regime
- Confidence gating at 0.6 threshold

---

### 3. Consensus Detection Logic ✅

**What It Does:**
Filters out weak signals and amplifies strong agreement among bots.

**Consensus Levels:**

**Strong Consensus (≥80%)**:
- Confidence amplified by 1.2x
- Indicates very high agreement
- Most reliable signals

**Standard Consensus (60-80%)**:
- Normal weighting applied
- Good agreement level
- Reliable signals

**No Consensus (<60%)**:
- Signal rejected (returns null)
- Too much conflict
- Prevents bad trades

**Example:**
```
42 bots voted:
- 38 LONG (90.5%) ← Strong consensus
- 4 SHORT (9.5%)

Result: LONG signal with 1.2x confidence boost
Final confidence: 0.88 → 1.056 (capped at 0.95)
```

**Implementation:**
- File: `supabase/functions/scan-run/regime-aware-aggregator.ts`
- Automatic filtering
- Smart amplification

```
size = min((2 / stopLossDistance) × 100, 10)
Example: (2 / 3.5) × 100 = 57% (capped at 10%)
```
