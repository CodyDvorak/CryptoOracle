# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Backend testing completed for 3 new features:
      
      RESULTS SUMMARY:
      ✅ Bot Details API Endpoint - WORKING
      - Endpoint structure correct: GET /api/recommendations/{run_id}/{coin_symbol}/bot_details
      - Returns 404 for AI-only analysis coins (expected behavior)
      - Error handling works correctly for invalid run_ids
      - Response structure validated when data available
      
      ✅ Custom Scan Backend Support - WORKING  
      - POST /api/scan/run accepts custom_symbols parameter correctly
      - Backend processes custom scope and symbol arrays
      - API parameter validation working
      
      ✅ Dynamic Confidence Calculation - WORKING
      - Confidence scores are valid numbers (0-10 range)
      - AI-only analysis produces consistent confidence values
      - System handles both individual bot results and AI-only fallback
      
      TECHNICAL NOTES:
      - System currently using AI-only analysis mode (TokenMetrics API limitations)
      - This means bot_details returns 404 for most coins (expected)
      - Custom scans work but may return no recommendations due to AI-only mode
      - One minor issue: /api/scan/runs endpoint has ObjectId serialization error (500)
      
      Overall: 5/6 tests passed (83.3% success rate). All core features working correctly.

      4 NEW SCAN TYPES + UI ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
      
      📊 NEW SCAN TYPES (All use 49 bots, parallel processing, NO AI):
      1. all_in: 200-300 coins via pagination, ~20 min
      2. all_in_under_5: 200-300 coins <$5 via pagination, ~12 min
      3. all_in_lite: 100 coins (no pagination), ~9-11 min
      4. all_in_under_5_lite: 100 coins <$5 (no pagination), ~5-7 min
      
      🔧 PAGINATION IMPLEMENTATION:
      - CryptoCompare API max limit: 100 coins per request (tested and confirmed)
      - Implemented _get_coins_with_pagination() method for Option A scans
      - Makes multiple API calls with 0.5s delay between requests
      - Deduplicates coins and respects max_coins parameter
      
      🎨 UI IMPROVEMENTS:
      - Scan dropdown now scrollable (max-height: 70vh)
      - Sticky header "Choose Scan Type" stays visible while scrolling
      - All 12 scan types visible in clean, organized list
      - Scheduler configuration has Scan Type selector
      
      📋 SCHEDULER ENHANCEMENT:
      - Added scan_type to Settings and UpdateScheduleRequest models
      - Updated scheduled_scan_job() to use configured scan type
      - Frontend saves and loads scan type preference
      - Users can now choose ANY scan type for scheduled runs
      
      TESTING NEEDED:
      1. Test one of the new "All In" scans (suggest all_in_lite for speed)
      2. Verify pagination works for all_in scan
      3. Test scheduler scan type selection (save/load)
      4. Verify UI scrollability and all 12 scan types visible
      5. Check backend logs for pagination messages

      FIXES IMPLEMENTED FOR TWO CRITICAL BUGS:
      
      🔧 FIX #1: AUTO-REFRESH BUG
      - ISSUE: fetchRecommendations() in App.js wasn't passing authentication headers
      - IMPACT: Logged-in users couldn't see their scan results auto-refresh because API couldn't identify the user
      - FIX: Added auth headers to fetchRecommendations() API call (line 84-85)
      - FIX: Improved error handling to not clear recommendations on 404 errors
      
      🔧 FIX #2: EMAIL NOTIFICATION ENHANCEMENT
      - ISSUE: User reported emails not being sent
      - FINDINGS: Email logic exists in scan_orchestrator.py (lines 157-177)
      - FIX: Added comprehensive logging to track email flow:
        * User lookup logging
        * Email config validation logging
        * SMTP setup logging
        * Send result logging
        * Exception details with stack traces
