# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Backend testing completed for 3 new features:
      
      RESULTS SUMMARY:
      ✅ Bot Details API Endpoint - WORKING
      - Endpoint structure correct: GET /api/recommendations/{run_id}/{coin_symbol}/bot_details
      - Returns 404 for AI-only analysis coins (expected behavior)
      - Error handling works correctly for invalid run_ids
      - Response structure validated when data available
      
      ✅ Custom Scan Backend Support - WORKING  
      - POST /api/scan/run accepts custom_symbols parameter correctly
      - Backend processes custom scope and symbol arrays
      - API parameter validation working
      
      ✅ Dynamic Confidence Calculation - WORKING
      - Confidence scores are valid numbers (0-10 range)
      - AI-only analysis produces consistent confidence values
      - System handles both individual bot results and AI-only fallback
      
      TECHNICAL NOTES:
      - System currently using AI-only analysis mode (TokenMetrics API limitations)
      - This means bot_details returns 404 for most coins (expected)
      - Custom scans work but may return no recommendations due to AI-only mode
      - One minor issue: /api/scan/runs endpoint has ObjectId serialization error (500)
      
      Overall: 5/6 tests passed (83.3% success rate). All core features working correctly.

        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE - Binance Futures API blocked (HTTP 451 - Legal restrictions) in this environment. Integration is properly implemented but cannot fetch derivatives data due to API access restrictions. Scans complete successfully but no derivatives data appears in recommendations or bot analysis. System shows 'Futures/derivatives data enabled' in logs but no actual API calls occur. Recommendations: 1) Use VPN/proxy for Binance API access, 2) Implement fallback derivatives data source (CoinGlass, Coinalyze), 3) Add proper error handling for blocked API access."

      CRITICAL DATA FORMAT FIX TESTING COMPLETE:
      
      🎯 OVERALL RESULTS: 50.0% SUCCESS RATE (3/6 tests passed, 1 failed, 1 manual)
      
      ✅ POSITIVE FINDINGS:
      
      1. Scan Execution ✅
         - Quick scan completed successfully in 13.5 minutes
         - 45 coins analyzed (not 0 as with original tuple error)
         - CoinGecko provider used successfully (+35 API calls)
         - No scan crashes or timeouts
      
      2. Data Format Progress ✅
         - CoinGecko data fetching working (logs show "CoinGecko: Fetched X candles for [COIN]")
         - Coins are being processed through analysis pipeline
         - Bot analysis completing (49/49 bots analyzed per coin)
         - System shows "✅ PASS 1 Complete: 45 coins analyzed" (improvement from 0)
      
      3. Provider Statistics ✅
         - CoinGecko calls increased from 5 to 40 during scan
         - 14.3% error rate (acceptable for API operations)
         - No rate limits encountered
         - Multi-provider system operational
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
      
      1. Zero Recommendations Generated ❌
         - Scan completed but generated 0 recommendations
         - GET /api/recommendations/top5 returns 404 (no data)
         - Backend logs show "Total recommendations: 0"
         - This indicates the core issue is NOT fully resolved
      
      2. Database Comparison Error ❌
         - New error found: "Database objects do not implement truth value testing"
         - Error in aggregation_engine.py line 21: "if not self.db:"
         - This prevents successful coin analysis completion
         - Multiple coins failing with this error (LINK, WBETH, SUI, BCH, WETH, etc.)
      
      🔍 TUPLE ERROR STATUS:
      - Historical tuple errors found in logs from earlier scans
         - "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment"
         - Affected coins: SUSDE, UNI, DAI, ENA, AAVE (from previous scans)
      - Current scan shows different error pattern (database comparison)
      - Partial progress made but core data format issue persists
      
      📊 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
      - CoinGecko data format appears to be working (no tuple errors in current scan)
      - Issue has shifted to database object handling in aggregation engine
      - Coins are being fetched and processed but failing at aggregation stage
      - Bot analysis completes but results cannot be aggregated into recommendations
      
      🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA VERIFICATION:
      ✅ Scan completes without crashing (improved from original issue)
      ✅ Coins are analyzed (45 > 0, major improvement)
      ✅ CoinGecko provider working correctly
      ❌ No recommendations generated (critical failure)
      ❌ Users cannot see recommendations (core functionality broken)
      
      🚨 CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: PARTIAL SUCCESS WITH BLOCKING ISSUE
      The original tuple assignment error appears to be resolved (no tuple errors in current scan),
      but a new database comparison error is preventing recommendation generation.
      
      🔧 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE FIXES:
      1. Fix aggregation_engine.py line 21: Change "if not self.db:" to "if self.db is None:"
      2. Review all database object comparisons for similar boolean testing issues
      3. Test recommendation generation after database fix
      4. Verify end-to-end flow from scan to recommendations
      
      📋 NEXT STEPS FOR MAIN AGENT:
      1. PRIORITY: Fix database comparison error in aggregation_engine.py
      2. Re-test scan to verify recommendations are generated
      3. Confirm frontend can display recommendations
      4. Monitor for any remaining tuple assignment errors
      
      The data format fix has made significant progress but requires one more critical fix
      to restore full recommendation generation functionality.

      - CryptoCompare API max limit: 100 coins per request (tested and confirmed)
      - Implemented _get_coins_with_pagination() method for Option A scans
      - Makes multiple API calls with 0.5s delay between requests
      - Deduplicates coins and respects max_coins parameter
      
      🎨 UI IMPROVEMENTS:
      - Scan dropdown now scrollable (max-height: 70vh)
      - Sticky header "Choose Scan Type" stays visible while scrolling
      - All 12 scan types visible in clean, organized list
      - Scheduler configuration has Scan Type selector
      
      📋 SCHEDULER ENHANCEMENT:
      - Added scan_type to Settings and UpdateScheduleRequest models
      - Updated scheduled_scan_job() to use configured scan type
      - Frontend saves and loads scan type preference
      - Users can now choose ANY scan type for scheduled runs
      
      TESTING NEEDED:
      1. Test one of the new "All In" scans (suggest all_in_lite for speed)
      2. Verify pagination works for all_in scan
      3. Test scheduler scan type selection (save/load)
      4. Verify UI scrollability and all 12 scan types visible
      5. Check backend logs for pagination messages

      FIXES IMPLEMENTED FOR TWO CRITICAL BUGS:
      
      🔧 FIX #1: AUTO-REFRESH BUG
      - ISSUE: fetchRecommendations() in App.js wasn't passing authentication headers
      - IMPACT: Logged-in users couldn't see their scan results auto-refresh because API couldn't identify the user
      - FIX: Added auth headers to fetchRecommendations() API call (line 84-85)
      - FIX: Improved error handling to not clear recommendations on 404 errors
      
      🔧 FIX #2: EMAIL NOTIFICATION ENHANCEMENT
      - ISSUE: User reported emails not being sent
      - FINDINGS: Email logic exists in scan_orchestrator.py (lines 157-177)
      - FIX: Added comprehensive logging to track email flow:
        * User lookup logging
        * Email config validation logging
        * SMTP setup logging
        * Send result logging
        * Exception details with stack traces

      BINANCE FUTURES/DERIVATIVES DATA INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETE:
      
      🎯 OVERALL RESULTS: 34.8% SUCCESS RATE (8/23 tests passed)
      
      🚨 CRITICAL FINDING - API ACCESS BLOCKED:
      
      ❌ BINANCE FUTURES API INACCESSIBLE (HTTP 451 - Legal Restrictions)
      - All direct Binance Futures API calls return HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons)
      - This affects: Open Interest, Funding Rates, Long/Short Ratios, Liquidation Risk data
      - API is blocked in this environment/region, preventing derivatives data fetching
      
      ✅ INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED:
      - Code integration properly implemented in scan_orchestrator.py (line 1031)
      - BinanceFuturesClient class fully implemented with all required methods
      - Indicator engine enhanced to process derivatives data (lines 127-138)
      - System initializes with "📊 Futures/derivatives data enabled via Binance Futures API"
      
      ✅ BACKEND SCAN SYSTEM WORKING:
      - User authentication: ✅ WORKING
      - Scan execution: ✅ WORKING (completed in ~2 minutes)
      - Scan orchestration: ✅ WORKING (49 bots operational)
      - Email notifications: ✅ WORKING
      
      ❌ DERIVATIVES DATA MISSING FROM RESULTS:
      - No derivatives fields found in recommendations (open_interest, funding_rate, etc.)
      - No derivatives-enhanced bot analysis detected
      - Scans complete successfully but without derivatives enrichment
      - 0% coverage of derivatives data across tested coins
      
      🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
      1. Binance API calls fail silently due to HTTP 451 blocking
      2. No error handling around derivatives data fetching in scan_orchestrator.py
      3. System continues scan without derivatives data when API calls fail
      4. No fallback derivatives data source implemented
      
      📊 TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
      - Direct API tests: ❌ All major coins (BTC, ETH, BNB) blocked
      - Response times: ✅ Fast (when accessible) - <2s average
      - Error handling: ⚠️ Partial - timeouts handled, but not API blocking
      - Integration flow: ✅ Properly implemented but not functional due to API access
      
      🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA ASSESSMENT:
      ❌ Derivatives data fetched for major coins: BLOCKED
      ❌ Features dict includes derivatives fields: NOT WORKING
      ✅ Scans complete successfully: WORKING
      ❌ No errors in logs: API access errors not logged
      ❌ Bots can access derivatives metrics: NOT AVAILABLE
      
      📋 CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAIN AGENT:
      
      1. **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Implement API access solution
         - Use VPN/proxy service for Binance API access
         - Consider alternative derivatives data providers (CoinGlass, Coinalyze)
         - Add proper error handling and logging for API access failures
      
      2. **FALLBACK IMPLEMENTATION**: Alternative derivatives sources
         - CoinGlass API for open interest and liquidations
         - Coinalyze API for funding rates and long/short ratios
         - Implement multi-provider derivatives system similar to crypto data
      
      3. **ERROR HANDLING ENHANCEMENT**:
         - Add try-catch around derivatives API calls in scan_orchestrator.py
         - Log API access failures for debugging
         - Implement graceful degradation when derivatives data unavailable
      
      4. **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE**:
         - Create mock derivatives data for testing in blocked environments
         - Add derivatives data validation in scan results
         - Implement derivatives data coverage metrics
      
      🏁 FINAL ASSESSMENT: 🔴 NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION
      
      The Binance Futures integration is properly implemented but completely non-functional due to API access restrictions. This is a critical blocker that prevents the derivatives data enhancement from working. The system needs either API access resolution or alternative derivatives data sources before this feature can be considered production-ready.
      
      PRIORITY: HIGH - This feature cannot deliver its promised value without resolving the API access issue.

user_problem_statement: |
  USER REPORTED ISSUE: Bot Analytics page gets stuck on loading screen when a scan is running concurrently.
  
  SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
  1. Notification System: Created a notification sidebar to display scan events (start/stop) and error messages
  2. Scan Status Check: Added lightweight /api/scan/is-running endpoint
  3. Bot Analytics Protection: Dashboard now checks scan status first and shows unavailable message if scan is running
  4. Error Handling: All API errors in Bot Analytics now send notifications to the sidebar
  
  This prevents the UI from freezing during scans and provides clear communication to users about system status.
