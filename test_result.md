# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      STEP 1: TESTING EXISTING SCAN TYPES
      
      User requested to:
      1. Test existing scan types first
      2. Investigate API limits for going beyond 86 coins
      3. Wait for findings before implementing "All In" scan
      
      CURRENT STATE:
      - 8 scan types implemented with varying speeds (3 min to 65 min)
      - Frontend dropdown UI with all 8 types + tooltips
      - CryptoCompare API currently set to fetch top 100 coins (limit parameter)
      - App typically processes 86 coins in full scans
      
      API INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:
      - File: backend/services/cryptocompare_client.py
      - Current API call: /data/top/mktcapfull with limit=100 (line 36)
      - CryptoCompare allows fetching up to 100 coins in a single request
      - For more coins, we would need to either:
        a) Use multiple API calls with pagination (tsym parameter)
        b) Use a different endpoint (e.g., /data/all/coinlist for ALL coins)
      - The 86 number likely comes from the actual coins returned that meet criteria (price > 0, valid data)
      
      TESTING REQUEST:
      Please test 2-3 representative scan types to verify they're working:
      1. speed_run (fastest: 40 coins, 25 bots, ~3 min)
      2. complete_market_scan (86 coins, 49 bots, parallel, ~9 min)
      3. Verify all scan types are accessible via API
      
      After testing, I will report findings to user about API limits and options for "All In" scan.

      FIXES IMPLEMENTED FOR TWO CRITICAL BUGS:
      
      🔧 FIX #1: AUTO-REFRESH BUG
      - ISSUE: fetchRecommendations() in App.js wasn't passing authentication headers
      - IMPACT: Logged-in users couldn't see their scan results auto-refresh because API couldn't identify the user
      - FIX: Added auth headers to fetchRecommendations() API call (line 84-85)
      - FIX: Improved error handling to not clear recommendations on 404 errors
      
      🔧 FIX #2: EMAIL NOTIFICATION ENHANCEMENT
      - ISSUE: User reported emails not being sent
      - FINDINGS: Email logic exists in scan_orchestrator.py (lines 157-177)
      - FIX: Added comprehensive logging to track email flow:
        * User lookup logging
        * Email config validation logging
        * SMTP setup logging
