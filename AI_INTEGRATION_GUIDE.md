# AI-Powered Analysis Integration Guide

## Current Status
‚ùå **NOT INTEGRATED** - The AI refinement service exists but is not being called during scans.

## What You Need

### Option 1: Use Without API Keys (Rule-Based Analysis)
The AI service has a sophisticated **rule-based fallback** that works without any API keys. It analyzes:
- Bot consensus strength
- Market regime confidence
- Multi-timeframe alignment
- Social sentiment correlation
- On-chain data signals

**Cost:** FREE
**Setup Time:** 5 minutes
**Quality:** Good (algorithmic analysis)

### Option 2: Use Groq API (Recommended)
**Model:** Llama 3.1 70B Versatile
**Cost:** FREE (generous free tier)
**Setup:** Get API key from https://console.groq.com
**Quality:** Excellent (LLM-powered analysis)

### Option 3: Use Google Gemini API
**Model:** Gemini 1.5 Flash
**Cost:** FREE tier available
**Setup:** Get API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
**Quality:** Excellent (LLM-powered analysis)

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add API Keys (Optional)

If you want LLM-powered analysis, add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Option A: Use Groq (Recommended - Fast & Free)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Option B: Use Google Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# You can add both - Groq will be tried first, Gemini as backup
```

**Get Groq API Key:**
1. Go to https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create new API key
5. Copy and add to `.env`

**Get Gemini API Key:**
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create API key
4. Copy and add to `.env`

### Step 2: Integrate AI Service into Scan Flow

The AI service needs to be called in `scan-run/index.ts`. Here's what needs to be added:

1. **Import the service** (top of file)
2. **Call it for each coin** that passes bot consensus
3. **Use the refined confidence** instead of basic avgConfidence
4. **Store the AI reasoning** in the recommendation

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Edge Function

After integration, the scan-run Edge Function needs to be redeployed with the AI service included.

## What AI Analysis Provides

### With API Keys (LLM Analysis):
- **Refined Confidence Score** - AI adjusts bot confidence based on full context
- **Detailed Reasoning** - Natural language explanation of the signal
- **Action Plan** - Specific steps and position sizing recommendations
- **Risk Assessment** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- **Market Context** - Broader market conditions and correlation analysis

### Without API Keys (Rule-Based):
- **Refined Confidence Score** - Algorithmic adjustments based on:
  - Bot consensus strength (80%+ agreement = boost)
  - Market regime confidence
  - Multi-timeframe alignment
  - Sentiment correlation
  - On-chain data confirmation
- **Structured Reasoning** - Rule-based explanation
- **Action Plan** - Position sizing based on confidence
- **Risk Assessment** - Standard risk factors
- **Market Context** - Data-driven context summary

## Benefits

### Current (No AI):
- Basic TokenMetrics recommendation matching
- Simple confidence multipliers
- Generic reasoning like "TokenMetrics confirms consensus"

### With AI Integration:
- Multi-signal aggregation (bots + sentiment + on-chain + regime + timeframe)
- Context-aware confidence adjustments
- Detailed, actionable trading insights
- Risk-aware recommendations
- Market regime consideration
- Time-tested technical factors

## Example AI Output

### Current:
```
ai_reasoning: "TokenMetrics STRONG_BUY confirms bot consensus"
```

### With AI (Rule-Based):
```
ai_reasoning: "Strong consensus (87% agreement). Strong BULL regime (92% confidence). Multi-timeframe alignment confirmed. Bullish social sentiment confirms signal"

action_plan: "Strong signal - consider LONG position
Entry: $45234.56
Position size: 3-5% of portfolio"

risk_assessment: "Stop loss required at support levels. Monitor regime changes that could invalidate signal"
```

### With AI (LLM-Powered):
```
ai_reasoning: "Bitcoin shows exceptional technical strength with 87% bot consensus for LONG. The combination of strong bull regime (92% confidence), aligned timeframes across 1H/4H/1D, and bullish social sentiment creates a high-probability setup. RSI momentum, MACD crossover, and EMA alignment all confirm bullish continuation. On-chain metrics show accumulation pattern with exchange outflows increasing."

action_plan: "Recommended LONG entry at $45,234.56
- Position size: 3-5% of portfolio
- First target: $47,500 (5% gain)
- Second target: $49,800 (10% gain)
- Stop loss: $43,700 (3.4% risk)
- Risk/Reward: 1:2.9
Consider scaling in with 50% at current level, 50% on any dip to $44,800"

risk_assessment: "Primary risk: Broader market correlation if S&P500 turns bearish. Watch for regime change signals below $43,500. Monitor funding rates - if they spike above 0.05% consider taking partial profits. Current volatility moderate (ATR 3.2%) supports position holding."
```

## Cost Comparison

| Provider | Model | Rate Limit | Cost per 1M tokens |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Groq | Llama 3.1 70B | 30 req/min | FREE tier |
| Gemini | 1.5 Flash | 15 req/min | FREE tier |
| Rule-Based | N/A | Unlimited | $0 |

**Estimated Usage:**
- ~1 API call per coin recommendation (only coins with strong bot consensus)
- ~20-30 recommendations per scan
- With free tiers: 1000+ scans per month at no cost

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** - I can integrate the AI service right now (works without API keys)
2. **Optional** - You add API keys later if you want LLM analysis
3. **Deploy** - Updated edge function with AI integration

Would you like me to integrate it now?
