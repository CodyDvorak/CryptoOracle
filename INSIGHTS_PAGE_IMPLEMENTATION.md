## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Files Created**:
1. `src/pages/Insights.jsx` (520 lines)
2. `src/pages/Insights.css` (570 lines)

### **Files Modified**:
1. `src/App.jsx`:
   - Added Insights import
   - Added Lightbulb icon
   - Added `/insights` navigation link
   - Added `/insights` route

### **Database Integration**:
- Queries `scan_runs` for latest completed scan
- Queries `recommendations` for coin-specific signals
- Queries `bot_predictions` for individual bot votes
- Uses Supabase client for all data fetching

### **Mock Data Generation**:
Currently using mock data generators for demonstration:
- `generateMockOnChainData()`: Simulates whale activity, flows, network stats
- `generateMockSentimentData()`: Simulates Reddit, CryptoPanic, NewsAPI scores
- `generateMockOptionsData()`: Simulates Deribit options data

**Note**: These can be replaced with actual API calls when backend services are connected to the scan-run function's real data.

### **2. Confirmation Signal**:
Validate bot recommendations by checking:
- If bots say LONG, is on-chain data bullish?
- If sentiment is extreme, is it time to fade?
- Are options traders positioned the same way?

### **3. Market Intelligence**:
Understand broader market context:
- Whale movements = Smart money positioning
- Sentiment extremes = Potential reversals
